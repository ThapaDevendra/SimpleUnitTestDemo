Good thing about this class today was about testing our source code
as we go along throungh and making sure there is no bug and can easily
find the error in our code within a seconds. Instead of finishing whole
project and spending time where it went wrong. This seems very helpful
in long run especially when we starts writing coding lines of thousands.
Great and easy to understand lecture. I enjoyed learning this class
today.
